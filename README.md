# FluxyTodo
FluxyTodo is an Android application that serves to demonstrate a few different things.
- It is an example of how to use [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) and [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) for DI (dependency injection) in and how to use [Otto](http://square.github.io/otto/) to decouple Android applications.
- It also serves as a proof of concept for a new Android application architecture I came up with.
- It promotes dependency injection, TDD (test driven development), and a unidirectional data-flow, which makes the separation of view and business logic simple and clear.

#### More information about what, why, and how, can be found in my [accompanying blog post](http://armueller.github.io/android/2015/03/29/flux-and-android.html).

## Future work
Despite the fact that this app is completely self contained (similar to how the todo app works from Facebook's Flux), I am pretty satisfied with out it turned out.  I came up with a couple different ideas on how server communication might be incorporated into this architecture, but I wasn't really happy with any of them.  Obviously, to be complete, server communication must fit into the equation somewhere, so that's what I'll be working on next.  Once I come up with a solution that im satisfied with, I will update this repo and my blog post to reflect what I came up with.

### Todo:
- Figure out how to incorporate server communication into architecture
- Set up db at firebase for todos
- Make app sync data to firebase
- Revise blog to incorporate server communication into architecture
- Update repo
